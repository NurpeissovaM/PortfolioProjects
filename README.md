# PortfolioProjects

## There are some different projects that I made
### 1. Covid project on SQL

Based on the data from OurWorldInData.org I made some insights, got information about covid 
for example:
- which countries are with the highest infection rate compared to population
- what percentage of population got covid
- showing countries, continents with the highest death count per population
- looking at total population vs vaccinations


### 2. Movies project

Based on data of Netflix from Keggle 
- first of all, looked for missing and null data, prepared data for analysis
- Avengers The end game made the biggest budget among all movies
- calculated correlation between year, score, votes, budget, gross, runtime and found big correlation between  budget and gross (0.75), votes and gross (0.63)

### 3. Parsind stock data

The project is Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data
The notebook includes three parts:
In the first section I extract stock data using a Python library, especially yfinance library, that allows to extract data for stocks returning data in a pandas dataframe.
In the second I download webpage using Requests Library Parsing, then parse webpage HTML using BeautifulSoup to a dataframe
In the third after extracting some stock data, I  display it in a graph.
